This repository contains my portfolio. It is meant to showcase my skills in areas other than labwork related. My goal is to be able to present to a future employer what it is I can do and such this portfolio will change greatly over time.

I hope you will enjoy reading this and thank you for your time!

In this project most of the coding is done in R and Rmarkdown, with a little bit of Bash and YML on the side.
