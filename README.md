This repository contains my portfolio. It is meant to showcase my skills in data analysis. My goal is to be able to present to a future employer what it is I can do and such this portfolio will change greatly over time. As of now I am very much in the beginning of my journey and looking for an internship to improve my skills in a certain direction. For me my interest lies especially in next generation sequencing. I have worked on some NGS projects trough my university and I very much like how it goes hand in hand with understanding the biology of organisms to better interpret the results. 

Making this portfolio has been a great learning experience and I will be keeping this update regularly. I have plans to include a RNA-seq analysis, Metagenomics pipeline and to keep working on the scRNA-seq skills as I find it very interesting. I would have liked to have one pipeline finished by now (12-06-2022) for the SnapATAC2 package but sadly I haven't figured out how to install and run the package properly on my device so that stands at the front of my to do list. Also I would like to improve on the skills I already posses and will make the pages in this portfolio go more in depth on the different basic skills to better showcase what I can do.

I hope you will enjoy reading this and thank you for your time!

In this project most of the coding is done in R, with a little bit of Bash, CSS, YML, SQL and HTML on the side.
