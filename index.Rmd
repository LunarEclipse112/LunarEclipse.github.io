# Welcome!

Hi! And welcome, this is my portfolio. It is a collection of different skills I posses and a way to show what I can do in a data analysis context. Each page contains a different group of skills and stands alone in its presentation. Also good to know is that this is of course, an ongoing process.

## About Me

I am a student of the university of applied sciences Utrecht. I have great passion for biology and data analysis. A work enviorment where I can implement both those interests is a dream job for me. With my biology background and data analysis knowledge I can be a bridge between lab analysts and data scientists. I am a transgender nonbinary individual, This means I go by they/them (die/diens of hen/hun). Usually this isn’t something I place too much importance on, I just live my life like anyone else but it might have some implications in the future regarding out of the blue surgeries. I don’t expect this to happen in the following year but just in case I do feel like my future employer should be informed about this.
