# Welcome!

Hi! And welcome, this is my portfolio. It is a collection of different skills and projects to showcase what I can do. Each page contains a different group of skills and stands alone in its presentation. This website is an ongoing work in progress.

## About Me

I studied Life sciences at the university of applied sciences Utrecht. Within my degree I specialized in bio-molecular research and Data analysis and visualization. I am very passionate about biology, molecular life
sciences and data analysis. A work environment where I can combine those interests is a dream job for
me. With my specialization in bio-molecular research and data analysis knowledge I can be a bridge
between lab analysis and data scientist.
